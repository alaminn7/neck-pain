                            <p><strong>Summary: </strong>Neck pain is a common problem with few solutions. But thanks to the Neck Relax, that’s about to change. This small device eliminated muscle tension and releases the pinched nerves. With the use of Neck Relax, you will be able to rest well and your neck pains will disappear in some time. If you suffer from pain in your neck and you just cannot bear it anymore, <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/2Wut1Xl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then you can get Neck Relax with 50% Discount and Free Delivery!</a></strong></p>
                        </div>

                        <p><i><strong>Do you suffer from neck pain and has it made your life miserable? Do you suffer pain or discomfort in the neck and upper back? Do you often feel that you would need a massage to relieve and decompress that area? Is it difficult for you to afford the time and money for physiotherapy?</strong></i></p>

                        <p>Neck pain is very common in people since a lot of people work on their laptops and sitting straight up for so long can cause neck pain.</p>

                        <p>As you probably know, everyday use of computers and smartphones can cause severe neck pain.</p>

                        <p>You know what it’s like...</p>

                        <p>Sitting up hurts. Bending over hurts. Turning your head hurts. Sometimes you can’t even get comfortable enough to sleep at night.</p>

                        <p>To make matters worse, the pain seems near impossible to get rid – no matter how much rubbing, rolling, massaging, or pressing on sore spots you do.</p>

                        <p>What if I told you there was a breakthrough device that could<strong> alleviate neck pain in just minutes a day?</strong></p>

                        <h3>What Are We Talking About?</h3>

                        <div class="text-center mb-3">

                        </div>

                        <p>When your neck is feeling off, the problem is typically tension in the muscles that surround the vertebrae in your neck. Neck Relax is a state-of-the-art portable neck pain massager. This small device eliminates muscle tension and relaxes your vertical spine – feels better than a massage!</p>

                        <p>Neck Relax is both innovative and <strong>very effective</strong>. Without being too technical, Neck Relax uses not one, but THREE effective tension, pain and stress relief methods. First, it uses<strong> Infrared Heat</strong>. Professional athletes use this method for healing sore and injured muscles. It improves circulation under your skin and focuses important oxygen and nutrients to injured tissues, promoting healing. It helps ease pain, relieves inflammation, and protect against oxidative stress.</p>

                        <p>Next, a special <strong>Electro Frequency Stimulation Massage Therapy.</strong> EFSMT treats any muscle spasms and nerve pain.

                        <h2 class="mt-mb-5">What Makes Neck Relax so Unique?</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>You Can Use Neck Relax Anytime, Anywhere</strong> – giving you the flexibility to use it after a stressful day of work in the comfort of your own bedroom, in your hotel room or even during a long flight!</li>
                            <li><strong>Fits into your busy schedule – </strong>Neck pain never happens at a convenient time. So, use Neck Relax whenever you need it. A single session can melt away the pain in as a little as a few minutes!</li>
                            <li><strong>Melts away stress and anxiety ;– </strong>Customers report that Neck Relax is so relaxing, you’ll have to try not to fall asleep while using it!</li>
                            <li><strong>Perfect for travel</strong> – Easily stores in your luggage when traveling, or simply place in your dresser when you’re done at home. It has no moving parts, and no setup or batteries are required. Hand washable, one size fits all!</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>

                        <p>That's what we all want to know, right?</p>

                        <p>It’s now discounted down to <strong><span style="color: #339966;">$49</span></strong> (<span style="color: #333333;">from <span style="color: #ff0000;">$99.99</span></span>), which is nothing when you consider the alternatives. Physiotherapists make you pay for a month in advance. Anti-stress drugs are addictive and harmful. Neck Relax gives you results, from your own home.</p>

                        <p>Plus it actually works!</p>

                        <p>When you think about how long you spend in pain or miserable because you are tense in the neck $49 seems like a good deal!</p>

                        <p>We think the price is great to keep yourself stress and pain-free, and healthy in body and mind.</p>
                        <h2>Does Neck Relax Really Work In Real Life?</h2>

                        <p>The results speak for themselves:</p>

                        <blockquote><p>I work all day at my desk. I don’t exercise as much as I should. Ok, that’s a lie, I never exercise… my bad posture is why I’m always getting neck and back pain almost daily. I tried Neck Relax for 10mins this afternoon on my lunch break. It felt amazing, I didn’t want to take it off! For sure I feel less stressed and ‘looser’ around my tense upper back and neck. I will be ordering my own today!</p></blockquote>

                        <blockquote><p>I love my job, but deadlines and traveling can be VERY stressful and uncomfortable sometimes. I used to go to a masseuse every weekend, but it just got too expensive. Plus I had to drive across the city for the appointment, which made me more stressed! Neck Relax gives me the same feeling and it costs basically nothing in comparison! I am a BIG fan already!</p></blockquote>
